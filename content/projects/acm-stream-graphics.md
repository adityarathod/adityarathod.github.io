Basic React-based dynamic, animated broadcast graphics toolkit.

Used in production for self-directed live in-person and streamed events, of sizes ranging from 500 to 1k+ total attendance.

See it in action (00:00 to about 05:30):

Here's the stream dashboard with scene groups (set of scenes played in sequence on repeat) and now-playing indicator toggles (that change content on lower-third titles):

Here's the stream graphics view on a viewport sized larger than 1080p:

The code is not yet available publicly due proprietary assets, spaghetti code, and improper architecture.

I'm working on cleaning it up and making it available when I have time.
