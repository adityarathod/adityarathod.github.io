Developed large-scale log event ingestion and query service leveraging C# and Elasticsearch. The goal was to make a more flexible, hackable alternative to Splunk.

As part of the project, I also developed a novel query language and query parser to enable users to query logs using simplified syntax. I spent a lot of effort on this, and it was a lot of fun.
