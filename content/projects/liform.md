This was my first-ever hackathon project! I built an app to compare treatment costs across multiple providers with my hackathon team. We leveraged open hospital chargemasters and Medicare diagnosis codes; since a lot of this data was unclean, I also wrote an ETL pipeline in Python to extract pricing data.
