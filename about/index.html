			<hr>
			<p>My name is Aditya, and AppleCrazy has been my Internet pseudonym for a while now.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I am a high school student in the SF Bay Area who likes to build and share interesting things. The majority of my
				experience is in the JavaScript ecosystem (Node, Express, React) and scientific Python (numpy,
				pandas), and as such, many of my projects are written in Python or JavaScript. I am comfortable around *nix shells,
				and am constantly trying to improve my Spacemacs skills. My current area of focus/learning is Deep Learning, after
				having completed Andrew Ng's Machine Learning class on
				Coursera. I expect to know the basics of Deep Learning by mid-2019 (along with a project).</p>
			<br>
			<p>I also sometimes also write posts for my blog (linked above). These are long, often narrative-type articles that
				detail my journey or thought process on a small project. My articles have appeared on the Hacker News frontpage and
				have been linked to and discussed by The Verge and TechCrunch. My hope is that you find these articles as
				interesting to read as they were to write.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Drop me a line at <code>emailapplecrazy</code> at <code>gmail</code> dot <code>com</code> if there is anything
				you want to talk about.</p>
